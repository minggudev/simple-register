## Installation
To use the Modern Register Form in your project, follow these steps:

1. Download the source code files for the register form.
2. Include the necessary CSS and JavaScript files in your HTML document. Make sure to maintain the folder structure of the downloaded files.
   ```html
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="path/to/register-form.css">
   <script src="path/to/register-form.js"></script>
Create an HTML container element where you want to display the register form.
html
Copy code
<div id="register-container"></div>
Initialize the register form by calling the initRegisterForm() function and passing the ID of the container element as an argument. This will render the register form inside the specified container.
html
Copy code
<script>
  // Replace 'register-container' with the ID of your container element
  initRegisterForm('register-container');
</script>
Customize the register form as needed by modifying the CSS and JavaScript files or adding your own styles and functionality.
Once you have completed these steps, the Modern Register Form will be successfully installed and ready to use in your project. Make sure to test it thoroughly and adapt it to your specific requirements.

Note: The register form relies on HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript features. Ensure that your target browsers support these technologies for proper functionality.
